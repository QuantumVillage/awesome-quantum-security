This is a repository for Quantum and Security related items that go into details about the security of, as well as threats from, quantum technologies. 

**NB** we aren't [awesome post quantum](https://github.com/veorq/awesome-post-quantum/), that's over there!

## PQC

There's a existing awesome list fo this! Go look over at [awesome post quantum](https://github.com/veorq/awesome-post-quantum/).

## Threats From Quantum Technologies

* [Introduction to Shor's Algorithm](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-quantum-computing-zero-to-shors-algorithm/) - An free introductory short course on Udemy.
* [Introduction to Grover's Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/concepts-grovers) - A short overview article from Azure Quantum about Grover's Search algorithm, with a deep dive on the mathematics and its geometric interpretation.

## Attacks on Quantum Algorithms

- [QDoor: Exploiting Approximate Synthesis for Backdoor Attacks in Quantum Neural Networks](https://doi.org/10.1109/QCE57702.2023.00124) - 2023-09-17 - Improving attack success rate against Quantum Machine Learning algorithms whilst evading known detection techniques.

## Defending Quantum Algorithms

- [Towards an Antivirus for Quantum Computers](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HOST54066.2022.9840181) - 2022-06-27 - A compile-time technique can be designed to scan quantum computer programs for malicious or suspicious code patterns before they are compiled into quantum circuits that run on a quantum computer.

## Threat Modelling Quantum Technologies



## QKD

* [Hacking QKD - Vadim Makarov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Phh-jO--bDU) - Quantum Village, DEF CON 33 - Talk from Prof. Makarov demonstrating a full security analysis of a QKD system, including how the vendor tried to fix it and how these patches were circumvented. Demonstrates several physics-based attacks on quantum key distribution systems.
* [Quantum Hacking](http://www.vad1.com/c/qcommce/2022/Makarov/slides/qcommce-l12-20221207.pdf) - slides from a talk given by Prof. Makarov in 2022 giving a broad overview of attacks against QKD.

## Quantum for Cybersecurity

Sometimes quantum technologies can be useful for helping solve problems in cybersecurity.

* [Cutting Medusa's Path](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13740) - 2022-11-24 - Paper exploring how quantum computing might help solve patch management.
