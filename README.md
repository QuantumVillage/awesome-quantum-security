This is a repository for Quantum and Security related items that go into details about the security of, as well as threats from, quantum technologies. 

**NB** we aren't [awesome post quantum](https://github.com/veorq/awesome-post-quantum/), that's over there!

## Threats From Quantum Technologies

* [Introduction to Shor's Algorithm](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-quantum-computing-zero-to-shors-algorithm/) - An free introductory short course on Udemy.

## Threat Modelling Quantum Technologies



## QKD

* [Hacking QKD - Vadim Makarov @ Quantum Village, DEF CON 33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Phh-jO--bDU) - Talk from Prof. Makarov demonstrating a full security analysis of a QKD system, including how the vendor tried to fix it and how these patches were circumvented. Demonstrates several physics-based attacks on quantum key distribution systems.
* [Quantum Hacking](http://www.vad1.com/c/qcommce/2022/Makarov/slides/qcommce-l12-20221207.pdf) - slides from a talk given by Prof. Makarov in 2022 giving a broad overview of attacks against QKD.

## PQC

There's a existing awesome list fo this! Go look over at [awesome post quantum](https://github.com/veorq/awesome-post-quantum/).

## Quantum for Cybersecurity

Sometimes quantum technologies can be useful for helping solve problems in cybersecurity.

* [Cutting Medusa's Path](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13740) - 2022-11-24 - Paper exploring how quantum computing might help solve patch management.
