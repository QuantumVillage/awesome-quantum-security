# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contirbutions of materials of all kinds! But here are some formatting guidelines for the most common types:

## How to add stuff

To add a URL to a tool post:

```
* [tool/website title](URL) - Brief description
```

To add a blog post, please use the following format:

```
* [Blog and Post Title](URL) - DATE YYYY-MM-DD - Brief description
```

To add papers into the right section - note that the date is optional, and YYYY-MM is usually sufficient, may be replaced by `CONFERENCE NAME 'YY`:

```
* [PAPER TITLE](PAPER URL) - DATE YYYY-MM-DD - Short Description
```

## Notes

Some notes about submissions:
* If you want to _add_ something, please fork the repo and make a PR with your additions!
* If you want to _remove_ something, please raise an issue for the offending commit, and provide us the reason for removal to review. 
* If a paper isn't free, please include the DOI, but don't link to something like scihub directly.
* If a blog or tool URL stops working, we'll remove it. So if something disappears, check the commit history.
